# Tic tac toe
This project is a tic tac toe game for N*N board.
The game starts by assuming first player is 'O'.

you can track the game stats at a game board where we show number of games won my each player (X and O).

We have 2 simple game controls : 
Reset : On pressing Reset will clear board, winner and game stats.
Play again: On pressing Play again button only the game board and winner will be cleared however game stats will still be shown.

Note : If you would like to contribute or suggest any changes to the codebase, or new feature we should add just raise an issue and we will take care of the implementation.
